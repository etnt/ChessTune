To fine-tune an open-source LLM for playing chess better, you'll need to follow these general steps:

Choose an LLM
Prepare your chess data
Set up the fine-tuning environment
Preprocess the data
Fine-tune the model
Evaluate and iterate
Here's a more detailed breakdown:
Choose an LLM:
Consider using models like GPT-2, GPT-Neo, or BERT. For chess, a smaller model might be sufficient and easier to work with.
Prepare your chess data:
Collect a large dataset of chess games in PGN (Portable Game Notation) format. You can find datasets on sites like lichess.org or chess.com.
Set up the fine-tuning environment:

Evaluate and iterate:
Test your model by having it generate chess moves and play against existing chess engines. Adjust your training data, hyperparameters, or model architecture based on performance.
Remember that this is a simplified approach. For optimal results, you might need to:
Use a larger dataset
Experiment with different model architectures
Implement custom loss functions that incorporate chess rules and strategies
Use reinforcement learning techniques to improve the model through self-play
Also, note that while this approach can improve the model's understanding of chess move sequences, it may not necessarily result in strong chess play without additional techniques to incorporate game rules, evaluation, and search algorithms.
